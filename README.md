## uMatrix Rules - Strict Cookie

This branch means more strict control in cookie. Specifically, you will have to manually allow cookie on any site because that:

1.  you are to login
1.  there is internal redirection(s)
1. some sites are broken from this

Rules for case 1 will **NOT** be here as that is your own responsibility by applying such a rule.
